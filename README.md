# mkdirtree - For making directory trees
This is a mini tool to facilitate making massive directory trees.

I mean I could've just done mkdir -p and dealt with all the brackets but where's the fun in that?

A directory is child to another directory if put a space before it under the parent directory that has no space... an example would do better explaining

```
parent_folder
 child_folder1
 child_folder2
  child_folder_of_child_folder2
  another_child_folder_of_child_folder_2
childless_folder
```
etc...
